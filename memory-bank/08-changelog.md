### Changed
- **Comprehensive Documentation Review & Alignment (2025-05-14):**
    - `docs/wolfram-sim-prd.md` reviewed and updated for clarity on hypergraph relation ordering and simulation loop rule application strategy.
    - All `memory-bank/` files (`00` through `07`, and `09` through `13` as applicable) reviewed for accuracy, consistency with the PRD, and readiness for development.
    - Specific updates made to:
        - `01-productVision.md`: Verified alignment with PRD.
        - `02-techContext.md`: Updated "Last Updated" date to 2025-05-14.
        - `03-systemPatterns.md`: Updated "Last Updated" date to 2025-05-14; added details to Data Flow, Security, Scalability, and Cross-Cutting Concerns sections for MVP.
        - `04-database.md`: Updated "Last Updated" date to 2025-05-14.
        - `05-uidesign.md`: Updated "Last Updated" date to 2025-05-14; clarified Reset button behavior and initial control states.
        - `06-developmentPlan.md`: Updated "Last Updated" date to 2025-05-14; aligned hypergraph relation ordering and gRPC MVP scope with PRD.
        - `07-kanban.md`: Updated "Last Updated" date to 2025-05-14; aligned Phase 2 gRPC backlog tasks with PRD and refined development plan.
    - This changelog (`08-changelog.md`) updated to reflect this review process and set to 2025-05-14.

- **Development Plan Overhaul (2025-05-13):**
    - `06-developmentPlan.md` was significantly rewritten to provide a more detailed, technically robust, and structured plan for MVP development. This included:
        - Enhanced descriptions for Phase 1 (Rust Simulation Engine Core) deliverables (F1.1-F1.6) with deeper technical elaboration on data structures, algorithms (like sub-hypergraph isomorphism for F1.3), event management, and serialization.
        - Refined details for Phase 2 (gRPC) and Phase 3 (Frontend).
        - More granular sprint planning (Sprint 1 & 2 tasks detailed).
        - Expanded risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
        - Detailed illustrative module structures for the Rust backend (`wolfram_engine_core`).
- **Memory Bank Alignment (2025-05-13):**
    - `07-kanban.md` updated to reflect the new tasks and sprint structure from the revised development plan.
    - `02-techContext.md` updated to include `Serde` for serialization.
    - `03-systemPatterns.md` updated with more detailed backend component descriptions and module/crate structure for `wolfram_engine_core`.
    - `04-database.md` (title updated to `04-databaseAndDataPersistence.md` in content) updated to clarify file-based serialization (F1.6) as the MVP persistence model.
    - `05-uidesign.md` updated to include a "Reset" button and clarify inputs for initial state and rule definitions, aligning with the revised development plan.

## Version Numbering Convention

For MVP development, we will not use formal version numbers. Post-MVP releases will follow Semantic Versioning (X.Y.Z).
- **Major version (X)**: Significant changes that may introduce incompatible API changes
- **Minor version (Y)**: New functionality added in a backward-compatible manner
- **Patch version (Z)**: Backward-compatible bug fixes and small improvements
