## [Unreleased] - MVP Development

### Added
- Initial Project Setup:
    - Product Requirements Document (PRD) for MVP (`docs/wolfram-sim-prd.md`).
    - Memory Bank structure established (`memory-bank/`).
    - Core Memory Bank files populated based on PRD:
        - `01-productVision.md`
        - `02-techContext.md`
        - `03-systemPatterns.md`
        - `04-database.md`
        - `05-uidesign.md`
        - `06-developmentPlan.md`
        - `07-kanban.md` (initial setup)
        - `08-changelog.md` (this file)
        - `09-environment.md` (initial setup)
        - `10-ai-interaction-guidelines.md` (initial setup)
        - `11-code-snippets.md` (initial setup)
        - `12-decisions.md` (initial setup)
        - `13-quick-reference.md` (initial setup)
- Backend Setup (2025-05-13):
    - Rust backend project initialized using Cargo, with Tonic for gRPC services.
    - Defined initial Protocol Buffer (`.proto`) file for gRPC service and message structures.
- Frontend Setup (2025-05-13):
    - Frontend project initialized using React (with Vite) and TypeScript.
    - Configured gRPC-Web client code generation for the frontend.

### Changed
- **Development Plan Overhaul (2025-05-13):**
    - `06-developmentPlan.md` was significantly rewritten to provide a more detailed, technically robust, and structured plan for MVP development. This included:
        - Enhanced descriptions for Phase 1 (Rust Simulation Engine Core) deliverables (F1.1-F1.6) with deeper technical elaboration on data structures, algorithms (like sub-hypergraph isomorphism for F1.3), event management, and serialization.
        - Refined details for Phase 2 (gRPC) and Phase 3 (Frontend).
        - More granular sprint planning (Sprint 1 & 2 tasks detailed).
        - Expanded risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
        - Detailed illustrative module structures for the Rust backend (`wolfram_engine_core`).
- **Memory Bank Alignment (2025-05-13):**
    - `07-kanban.md` updated to reflect the new tasks and sprint structure from the revised development plan.
    - `02-techContext.md` updated to include `Serde` for serialization.
    - `03-systemPatterns.md` updated with more detailed backend component descriptions and module/crate structure for `wolfram_engine_core`.
    - `04-database.md` (title updated to `04-databaseAndDataPersistence.md` in content) updated to clarify file-based serialization (F1.6) as the MVP persistence model.
    - `05-uidesign.md` updated to include a "Reset" button and clarify inputs for initial state and rule definitions, aligning with the revised development plan.

## Version Numbering Convention

For MVP development, we will not use formal version numbers. Post-MVP releases will follow Semantic Versioning (X.Y.Z).
- **Major version (X)**: Significant changes that may introduce incompatible API changes
- **Minor version (Y)**: New functionality added in a backward-compatible manner
- **Patch version (Z)**: Backward-compatible bug fixes and small improvements
